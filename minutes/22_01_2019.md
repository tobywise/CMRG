# Agenda

## Updates/recap

### The goal of CMRG by Alex

- Develop a machine learning algorism to predict which tennis player to bet on.
- Define most successful algorithm as one that returns the most profit (highest return on investment) (Focused data set: Men singles)

### Previous algorithms for predicting tennis matches

- General 75% accuracy
- Return of investment = profit / amount staked
- Usually have a return of investment of around 6.85%
- Anything over 5% is considered to be good

### Python tutorial by Toby

- Jupyter Lab â€“ new interface *highly recommended

### Summary:

1. We will use Git to collaborate
2. We will use Slack to communicate
3. We will use Jupyter notebook to code

# Action(s)

### Everyone

- Download Jupyter notebook, Sckitlearn, Git on your local laptop
- Create a Git account and send your Git account name to Toby

### Toby

- Next week, Toby will give us a small intro to Git
- Toby will create a Git hub for collaboration
- Toby will share presentation slides with us through Git

### Alex

- Share tennis match data through Git or Slack

# Next session

- We will meet to understand how to use Git efficiently
- We will have a data set to run basic machine learning algorithm (which Toby explained on Jan 22nd, 2019)
