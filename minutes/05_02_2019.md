# Agenda

## Updates/recap

### Outcome variables

* Discussed best ways of coding target variables - Max suggested using both binary and continous, and perhaps combining predictions from classifiers designed to predict these.

### Data

* The data we currently have is somewhat limited
* Other data sets exist online but combining multiple datasets could be challenging as it's not obvious how to match matches from different datasets

### Reading in data directly from the web

* We managed to read data directly from a url, avoiding the need to download anything
    ```python
    import requests, zipfile, io
    r = requests.get('http://www.tennis-data.co.uk/2017/2017.zip')
    z = zipfile.ZipFile(io.BytesIO(r.content))
    df = pd.read_excel(z.open('2017.xlsx'.format(year)))
    ```

# Action(s)

* Try some basic predictions with the data we have

# Next session

Not entirely sure, Alex is far better at minuting than me.
