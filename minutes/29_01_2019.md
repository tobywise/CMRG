# Agenda

## Updates/recap

### Intro to git by Toby

* Commits updates the versions in the repository and writing commit messages explains what you have changed 
* Branches – clones repository – if you have a main piece of code that works you can create a branch that you can play around with and works
* Can push to online git repository
* Can use GUI – Source Tree

### Practiced reading in data to Jupyter

#### Outline

1) Import libraries
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy
    ```
2) Read in data using excel
    * If you need to install things open a terminal and type `pip install packagename`
    * To check which directory you are in if you need to find a file:
    ```python
    import os
    os.getcwd()
    ```
Data is structured with winners and losers all in the same column, so need to recode the data to give us a binary outcome variable

## Action(s)

* Send Toby Wise git user names and he can add us as collaborators 
* Download Source Tree
* Practice reading in data 
* Each person needs to think of one way to restructure the data so that we can fit a classifier

## Next session

We will discuss everyones ideas and work on our own computers to fit the classifier to the data
