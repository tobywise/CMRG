## Python installation instructions

1. Download [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/)
2. Check that your system has recognised this new version of Python. Type `python` as the terminal/command line and see what pops up - at the top it should say Anaconda somewhere. If not your computer is probably using another version of Python, in which case you'll need to add it to the system path (there are guides online for doing this).
3. Install Jupyter Lab - at the terminal/command line type `pip install jupyterlab`
4. Run Jupyter Lab by typing `jupyter lab` at the terminal.
